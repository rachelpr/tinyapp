# Tinyapp

This project is for making a URL shortening service similar to TinyURL, Bitly, or Goo.gl. It is created as part of my studies at Lighthouse Labs. It is a fullstack app created using Node and Express.

## Features
- Shortens a URL
- Edit or Delete a URL from the app
- Login/logout as needed

## How to Use
1. Install all dependencies using `npm install` command
2. Run the server using `node express_server.js`
3. Open `localhost:8080/urls` in your browser
